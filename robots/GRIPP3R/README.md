# GRIPP3R

> The GRIPP3R robot is constructed for some heavy-duty lifting. Itâ€™s got the muscle to grab and drop a can of soda with its powerful grasping grippers.

Control GRIPP3R as follows:

- Make GRIPP3R drive around by the IR Remote Control's blue and red buttons
- Make GRIPP3R grip or release an object by pressing the IR Remote Control's Beacon button
